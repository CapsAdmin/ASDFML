This makes it so you can run löve games in goluwa. The first game is [Mr. Rescue](https://tangramgames.itch.io/mrrescue) and the second one is [Sienna](https://tangramgames.itch.io/sienna) (Both created by [Tangram Games](http://tangramgames.dk/)). As with almost everything in Goluwa it's WIP. Some games work and some games don't.
