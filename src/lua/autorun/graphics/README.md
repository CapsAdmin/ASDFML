Sort of similar to PAC3 (a character editor I made for Garry's Mod). All objects have properties and some of them can be marked for being serialized. If they are you can edit them with this editor and save / load the entity entire tree.

#Chathud and chatbox
uses the [markup language](src/lua/libraries/graphics/gui)
